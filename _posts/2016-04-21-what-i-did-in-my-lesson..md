What I Did In My Lesson

In my most recent lesson we were looking at some of the prezi presentations, I really enjoyed this lesson because it gave me a bit of an idea of what other people had done and how I could learn from them. Mine was one of the ones shown and I was quite pleased with it but there were points for improvement.  Overall I really enjoyed this lesson because i was able to see other people's ideas.
