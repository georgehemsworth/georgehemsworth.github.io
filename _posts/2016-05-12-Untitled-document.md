What I did In My Lesson

In my most recent recent lesson we were looking at some more coding. This time it was tutorials which were considerably easier than the previous coding, however I think that this was a good thing to do because I think that previously we were a bit out of our depth and took on more than we could handle.

Overall I found this lesson easier than the last lesson but just as helpful.
