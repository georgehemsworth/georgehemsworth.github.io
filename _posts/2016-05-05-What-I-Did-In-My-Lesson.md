What I Did In My Lesson.

In my most recent lesson we were looking at more coding, we did one exercise in microbit about creating your own sorting hat, at first we did it with the Harry Potter houses but then we had to change them to our own houses like foxell, rayner, and so on. This was a very fun exercise but it was also quite challenging but that is a good thing because what's the point of doing something if you find it easy. Overall I enjoyed this lesson but struggled with some of the more advanced coding.
