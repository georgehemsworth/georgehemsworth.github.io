What I Did In My Lesson

In my last lesson we were watching video clips on social media and how they affected us. The advert we watched was on this girl who had gone on holiday and forgotten her phone and all her friends were on theirs constantly, everyone except her. The message the video was displaying was that if you are not careful then social media can take over your life. The way the video displayed that message was by showing viewers images of people taking selfies and posts instead of enjoying the moment.

Overall I enjoyed this lesson but it was also a very valuable one and was a real eye opener.
