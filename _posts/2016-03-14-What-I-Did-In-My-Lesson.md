What I Did In My Lesson

In our most recent lesson we were looking at social media and we looked at this sort of reenactment of what can happen if social media gets out of hand, what happened was these people started this competition to see who could get 1 million views the quickest, this started of as a harmless game but soon escalated and ended up with, inappropriate content being posted online, this really made me aware that there is also a bad side to social media aswell as a good side.

Overall the main thing I took from this lesson is that if you are not careful about what you put on the internet then something you do not want people to know about could be shared within seconds.
