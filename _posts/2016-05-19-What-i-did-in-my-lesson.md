What i did in my lesson

This lesson we did even more coding which slowly but surely i am getting the hang of, although i still struggle with the more complicated ones. We are still doing tutorials until our microbits come which is really annoying because i am really excited to get using them.

Overall i am enjoying tutorials but i really want the microbits to come so i can start using them.
