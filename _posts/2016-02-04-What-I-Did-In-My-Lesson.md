What I Did In My Lesson

In my most recent lesson mr.keen was talking to us about the advantages and disadvantages of social media, this subject showed me so many more good things about social media than i thought there was, such as how you can do charity work on there and how you can post advice about homework, in the lesson we also did another bit where we were given some cards and told to sort them out into which we thought were the worst things and what we thought were the least harmless things which was slightly controversial because everyone had different views. This exercise I enjoyed alot.

Overall I really enjoyed this lesson but sometimes found it tricky to put some of the cards in order.By George Hemsworth
