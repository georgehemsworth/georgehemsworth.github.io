What i did in my lesson 

In my most recent lesson we were talking about what scared us online this ranged from sexting to cyberbullying, the main thing this lesson taught me was that you always have to be very careful with what you do on the internet and also to be very careful about what you type in. My homework:[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24539514](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24539514) and [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30308942](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30308942)
