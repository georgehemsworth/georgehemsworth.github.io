What I did in my lesson

In my most recent lesson we played this sort of game were mr.keen asked us questions and we had to stand in the room where we felt felt about it. There were two sides of the room: disagree and agree. I enjoyed this exercise because it revealed many things about my friends that I did not know before, however on one particular question I answered a little bit differently than I would have if my friends had not been there because I did not want to seem uncool.

Overall I found this lesson very enjoyable but a little bit difficult to answer some of the questions.
