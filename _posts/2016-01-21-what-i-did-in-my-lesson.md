What I did in my lesson.

In my lesson we were talking about forms of media and what they are, i was very surprised to find out that media is not just twitter or facebook but things like chat rooms and newspaper's however i found this subject a bit tricky because i do not use websites like instagram or facebook but as we did more i understood it more and it was easier. But overall i still find this subject tricky.
