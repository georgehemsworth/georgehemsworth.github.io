What i did in my lesson

In my most recent lesson we were sharing our identity maps that we had done for homework, I really liked this lesson because it revealed a lot about other people that I did not know about before.

This exercise was also very good for me because I opened up a lot and that gave people the chance to learn more about me, however I can now see why it can be easy for people to be mean in this way, because it is anonymous, over the last six lessons I have learnt that it is much easier to be mean to somebody via social media because it is a lot easier to post something on the internet than it is to look that person that you are saying it to and say it. At the start of this topic I thought it was going to be boring because I thought that I knew most things about it but I was very wrong, I learnt a lot of knew things that i did not know before.I have really enjoyed this topic.
