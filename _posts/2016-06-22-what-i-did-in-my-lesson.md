What i did in my lesson

In my most recent lesson we were doing an anonymous survey, in this survey we were asked all sorts of questions ranging from what we do on our devices and if we are allowed wifi, the main thing i enjoyed about this lesson was knowing that the school does take our opinions into account and that they do want to keep us safe on the internet.
