What I Did In My Lesson

In my most recent lesson we were looking at the new bbc microchips which we are going to get, the software was a bit like scratch in that you had variables to make things move, on mine I managed to make my microchip show three different shapes without stopping although this lesson was quite fun it was also challenging because the programming was not always right and this was tricky to get right.   Overall I really enjoyed this lesson but some of the programming I found difficult.
